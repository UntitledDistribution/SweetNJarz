# Project SweetJar
This project was remade from memory after losing the original program due to corruption. This was assisted by Proton's Lumo (https://lumo.proton.me/) Artificial Intelligence in **2025**. This had demonstrated my interest in *Secure Public Kiosks* Like the ones you'd find in locations such as IKEA, I was fascinated. During the day when the program was being executed, some people discovered a way to crash the program... Luckily, my background 'watchdog' process kicked in and ensured the user wasn't doing anything they were not meant to be doing while the program was restarting. I had thought of every way that I would crash the program and implemented patches for it, even for when the program somehow died.

## Requirements
 -- OS: **Windows 10 or 11 64-bit** (Excluding 'S' or 'SE' editions)
 -- Debugging or modifying the program? **Visual Studio 2022**.

## Things to know:
